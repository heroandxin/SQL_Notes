Here is an example [LeetCode_Easy](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-the-team-size/).


```text
Table: Employee
+---------------+---------+
| Column Name   | Type    |
+---------------+---------+
| employee_id   | int     |
| team_id       | int     |
+---------------+---------+
employee_id is the primary key for this table.
Each row of this table contains the ID of each employee and their respective team.

Write an SQL query to find the team size of each of the employees.

Return result table in any order.


Input: 
Employee Table:
+-------------+------------+
| employee_id | team_id    |
+-------------+------------+
|     1       |     8      |
|     2       |     8      |
|     3       |     8      |
|     4       |     7      |
|     5       |     9      |
|     6       |     9      |
+-------------+------------+
Output: 
+-------------+------------+
| employee_id | team_size  |
+-------------+------------+
|     1       |     3      |
|     2       |     3      |
|     3       |     3      |
|     4       |     1      |
|     5       |     2      |
|     6       |     2      |
+-------------+------------+
Explanation: 
Employees with Id 1,2,3 are part of a team with team_id = 8.
Employee with Id 4 is part of a team with team_id = 7.
Employees with Id 5,6 are part of a team with team_id = 9.
```

```SQL
SELECT 
    employee_id,
    COUNT(employee_id) OVER (partition by team_id) AS team_size

FROM Employee
